# Introduction


Ever get tired of using your non-delicate fingers to place small boats on a battleship board?

***Well, fear no more!***

**BlottleShip**, an open-source battleship game generator designed for the Blot drawing machine (by hack club) is here to save families from this tedious process.

With BlottleShip, families and friends can finally engage with each other in a fun, yet competitive (not to mention chaotic) classic family board game in a whole new way!

## Prologue - basically stuff I said in the [PR](https://github.com/hackclub/blot/pull/733)
My artwork is a battleship board that can be playable and scalable (also responsive) when drawn. I intended this artwork to be interactive and admirable simultaneously, with the mesmerising grid pattern and captivating ship details. I am 13 y/o and have been learning programming for around 1 year, with beginner to intermediate experience in Javascript, React (& Native), C, C++, C#, Kotlin, HTML & CSS (Since 2021), and Python. My most proficient language should be Python since my school uses it to teach CS concepts. My first experience with JavaScript was an inter-school hackathon in November of 2023, which was my first time programming (By the way, I chose JavaScript due to my teammate's preference, and we got to the podium (3rd place) in that hackathon).
I think I worked 10+ hours on this project and I'm quite proud of the maths I learnt from it, especially trigonometry.

# So, how do I use it?
